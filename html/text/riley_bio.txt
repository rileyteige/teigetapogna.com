Riley grew up in Monroe, Washington with his parents, Holly and Michael, and his siblings, Connor, Ethan, and Emily. He enjoyed video games, trips to Alaska, and spending days with his friends. Throughout his teenage years, he practiced and performed on trumpet in both wind ensembles and jazz bands. He plays chess from time to time, and loves computers. He loves flying, and plans to build and fly his own planes after him and Angela have settled on their land into a home.

Riley is currently in his last year at Western Washington University, where in June he will graduate with his B.S. in Computer Science. For the time being, he provides internal software development services to Anvil Corporation, headquartered in Bellingham.

After they move to Kansas City, Missouri, Riley plans to work either remotely or locally for various companies in need of software construction. He plans to pick up his trumpet consistently again, and perform with local jazz groups.

Beyond that, Riley enjoys throwing a frisbee, baking bread, dancing (especially swing), programming, playing guitar and trumpet, and singing. He also loves a good show, and given his druthers, will plow through a series on Netflix like it's nobody's business. Currently, he and Angie are watching Star Trek TNG for the second time through and Battlestar Galactica.
