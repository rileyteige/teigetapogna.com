<b>The Proposal</b>

<br />
<br />

On November 3, 2012, Riley and Angie awoke to what Angie thought would be a normal Saturday. It was cold and rainy outside (the usual in the PNW), and they were going to spend the day together on a date. Interestingly, Riley told Angie that she needed to wear outside clothes. Puzzled, Angie went along with this suggestion and came out to see Riley preparing water bottles and snacks, and then she knew: They were going on a hike. The <em>night before</em>, however, Riley had taken her into the emergency room to be examined for a potential relapse of pneumonia. This led her to much confusion, but again, she went along with it. The two packed their things into Riley's car and left in the direction of Mt. Baker.

Almost to the forest road, they needed to stop for a day pass to park; it was here that Riley would have to give up his secret on their destination. When asked by the ranger where they were headed, Riley said, "Heliotrope Ridge". Angie got a smile on her face as she told Riley that she had known all along that this would be their hike. Heliotrope Ridge was the site of their first date; and now, taking her in the rain made sense.

Their first time on the trail, the two had been surprised by a much greater driving distance than expected, knee-high snow and a roadblock a mile prior to the trailhead. The temperature was well below freezing and they had come significantly unprepared. However, they had set out anyways amongst frozen streams, frozen waterfalls and an increasing snow depth. By the time the snow came up to their hips, Riley and Angie decided to have a picnic before setting down. Once they had gotten back to the car, Riley had the beginnings of frostbite on his knuckles; needless to say, the date went well.

That being said, Riley had decided that a rainy day on the trail with temperatures in the mid- to high-40s was not a problem. Having been warned about high water levels in the streams that crossed the trail, they set out for another pleasant hike. Enjoying the trees and wilderness, Riley and Angie eventually came to a stream they could not safely cross. This whole time, Riley had hidden an engagement ring, in its box, in a plastic baggy, in his jacket pocket. He had planned to reveal it at their picnic site, and now the plot was foiled by inclement weather (what a surprise in Washington). As they headed back down the mountain, Riley looked to the left, saw a waterfall, and to the right, a cliff. Riley pointed near the cliff and said, "You need to be there right now." The two stood, facing the view beyond the cliff's edge, enjoying Mother Nature at her finest.
