Angela was born and raised in Reno, Nevada by her parents, Sue and Steve, and both of her grandmothers, Martha and Evelyn. From the time she could say the word "horse" Angela has been absolutely horse-crazy and began her riding career at the age of four. She has continued following her passion and has won numerous medals and championships in Nevada, California, and Oregon. Currently she is working as an assistant riding instructor at Fox Bay Farm in Bellingham, Washington and is happy to finally have her horse with her. Anyone who knows Angela will tell you that there are two men in her life: one whom we all know and love as Riley Teige, but the other is of the four legged variety - her horse named DJ :)

In fourth grade Angela memorized all of the bones of the human body, and knew that she was destined for medicine. Her journey through academia was driven by the desire to eventually provide excellent patient care. She graduated 11th in her high school class of 400, earned a bachelor's of science from Western Washington University with a major in kinesiology and minors in German, chemistry, and biology. She was recently accepted into the DO program at Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences where she will finally achieve her goal of becoming a physician.

In what little free time Angela has, she enjoys playing her violin, swimming, hiking, ballroom dancing, and watching Star Trek TNG. She is very proud of her human heart model, Periodic Table of the Elements shower curtain, and the fact that she can recite all six hours of the REAL version of Pride and Prejudice, starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.
