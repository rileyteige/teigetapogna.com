<b>The Beginning</b>

On a Monday night in December 2010, a salsa lesson had been held at the Western campus. As after every lesson, an hour-long dance took place, and it was here that Riley first asked Angie to dance. After a successful bout with spins and dips, Riley thanked Angie for the dance, and the night progressed, seemingly as usual. However, during a break that spanned several songs, Riley had stood alongside the dance floor, observing many couples. It was here that Riley found his pause interrupted by a hand dragging him onto the dance floor. Looking to see who had the courage to direct him to a dance, he saw that it was Angie again, as she struck a latin pose, gearing for the next song. Impressed, Riley accepted the dance (as if he had a choice in this matter), and the two enjoyed another several minutes of salsa beats, trumpets and song. Following the dance, Riley and Angie took a seat near the dance space to get to know each other better. By this, we mean that Riley spent the next while learning about Angie's horse, DJ. At night's end, the two parted ways, not to see each other for the next several weeks.

The following January, Riley and Angie found each other at [surprise] another salsa lesson. After many dances together, Riley stood alongside the dance floor with his friend, Sean. During their chat, Angie came by to say goodbye to Riley; they hugged, and parted ways again. However, this time Riley realized that if he wanted to know this woman even better, he needed to do something about it. Seeing Angie across the room getting her bag to leave, Riley interrupted Sean mid-sentence to <em>just happen</em> to place himself at a drinking fountain near the exit. It was here that Riley asked Angie for her number, and the two were off. On February 6, Riley serenaded Angie with a birthday song, and Angie asked Riley to come by again to give her a lindy hop lesson.

On February 10, Riley made a visit to Angie's house to teach her the basics of lindy. Little did he know, she had no intentions of learning lindy hop this night. Angie had actually danced lindy several times past; ahh, how the plot unfolds. The two had decided to be dance partners in the salsa performance group for this year, and while preparing to leave for their first rehearsal, Angie decided to play one more song: <em>Fever by Michael Buble</em>. Switching from lindy to a blues dance, Riley and Angie shared their first kiss and finished their private dance. Walking to their rehearsal, each of them on Cloud 9, Riley asked Angie to be his girlfriend, and the story of RNA had begun.
