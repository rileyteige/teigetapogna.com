After a minute of enjoying the view (seemed like many more), Riley knew the moment was upon him. He first uttered words famously spoken by Mr. Darcy in Jane Austen's <em>Pride & Prejudice</em>, "In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings shall not be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you," then moved himself between Angie and the edge, her back to the waterfall. It was here that Riley told her what she and her companionship meant to him. His hands shaking (two reasons here: 1, nervous. 2, the lifetime warranty on the ring does not cover it falling off a cliff.), he took a knee and asked Angie to marry him. In disbelief and excitement, she said yes! After many hugs and kisses, Angie looked to Riley and said, "Well, are you going to put it on my finger or what?", as Riley had forgotten that he still held the ring in his hand. Removing the ring from its box, his hands still shaking (again, cliff), he placed the ring on her finger and the ride of their lives began.
